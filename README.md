# newsUmbrella

Exasperated of having to visit multiple news websites despite them being your favourites? Wish you had one hub? Let's put your exhaustion to rest as we present to you newsUmbrella, a **cornucopia of your best news delived under one hub.** 
<br />
<br />
And the best part is, the ultimate goal is to have **any news link work.** Yes, even local dailies, less-known sites or an individual's newsletter for which apis don't exist. Through web scraping, newsUmbrella seeks to parse anything!
